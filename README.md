# EnvSwitcher

A Chrome extension to switch between different versions of the same site - local, staging and live.
You can maintain the list of sites, even export and import as CSV.

Once downloaded, go to:
chrome://extensions/

Make sure Dev mod is enabled (top right)
Then click the "Load unpacked" button, and select the folder when you saved it.

You should then get a green leafy icon in your toolbar, you might need to click the jigsaw puzzle icon to see it, then pin it.

Next you just need to add URLs, which you can either add manually, by going to a URL and clicking the add button, or by importing a CSV.

If you're using Firefox, you'll need Firefox Developer Edition as normal Firefox doesn't allow unsigned extensions (https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/).
